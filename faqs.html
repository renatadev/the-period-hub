    <div class="content_toggle">
      <p class="answer">Is about fighting to end period poverty and the period stigma.
        We believe that menstrual hygiene is a right, not a privilege...
        that every person should be able to discover and reach their full potential,
        regardless of a natural need.
        Lack of access to menstrual products can create a
        barrier to equal opportunity in education, even causing students
        with periods to miss or be late to class,
        or feel anxious about their period care.
    PERIODS ARE NATURAL, AND PERIOD PRODUCTS SHOULD BE FREE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL STUDENTS.</p>

  <h1>How does the Donations work?</h1>
    <p>Every penny donated through "The Period Hub" will be splited in equal percentages (%) in between all of the organizatios we work with!</p>

  <h1>What is Period Poverty?</h1>
    <p>Not having the resources to manage your period. This doesn’t just mean financial resources, it’s also about not having access to appropriate products or not having sufficient knowledge, due to a lack of education, on how to manage your period.  </p>

  <h1>Why does the Period Poverty still exist in the UK?</h1>
    <p>In the UK, research has shown that women spend over £18,000 on their periods over the course of their lifetime.
  Additionally, we are still paying a 5% VAT as they’re deemed a ‘luxury item’. Jaffa Cakes are considered an essential item, and so, remain untaxed. This is a sexist levy that upholds the taboo around periods.
  As poverty and governmental cutbacks bite, and we see a growing dependence on food bank handouts, menstrual products become an unattainable luxury to many.
  The shame and embarrassment around menstruation is still so prolific, that many people suffer alone, and in silence, reluctant to ask for help when they need it.
  </p>

  <h1>Why should you bother donating?</h1>
    <p>Research has shown that period poverty is a real issue right here in the UK. No More Taboo wants to tackle this issue, and through hosting one of our workshops we can work together to create positive change for people who have difficulty accessing menstrual products, or who have issues with their menstrual health. Receiving a reusable menstrual product from No More Taboo is a much more financially sustainable way of managing periods, as they last between 3 and 10 years. They are also unbleached and free of undisclosed chemicals, making them much better for our bodies. </p>

  <h1>What are the organizations you sponsor?</h1>
    <p>We sponsor these 4 fabulous organizations: ......</p>

  <h1>I don't menstruate - why should I get involved?</h1>
    <p>You may not menstruate, but everyone has a mother, daughter, sister, aunty or friend that they care about who does. Society as a whole has created the taboos around menstruation, so we must all work together to break down these taboos. If we are all well educated about menstruation, we can be more empathetic and understand some of the issues better. We encourage all genders to engage with our education when working in developing countries and so do the same here in the UK.</p>

  <h1>Is period a taboo? Really?</h1>
    <p>Of course it is - if we are still too embarrassed to discuss menstruation with others, they must still exist. What about the taboo of menstrual waste? We have banned plastic bags in the UK, yet one pack of disposable pads contain the equivalent of 4 plastic bags in each one. What about the taboo surrounding education? Many women still don’t know about basic aspects of their menstruation or practices around it. For example, many don’t know you shouldn’t flush tampons because they cause major problems to sewage systems, but no one ever told them. Or what about the taboo of women and girls living in poverty in the UK not having the money to buy pads or tampons?</p>
