<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>These are the projects we are working with, our allies have
created their own campaings for the same exact reason:</p>
<h2>The archaic perception of periods as a source of shame and embarrassment.
   Misogyny has meant that periods are ubiquitously tabooed,
   belittled and euphemized.
 This is so wrong. We need to celebrate our periods,
 unapologetically, and it's incredibly important to
 involve boys and men (and others who don't have periods)
 in the conversation, if we want to overcome the
 stigma that shrouds menstruation.</h2>
 <p>And for these, and some many other reasons we invite you to take
 a look at these incredible projects, follow them and support them.</p>

<h3 id="#red-box">The Red Box Project</h3>
  <p>The RBP is a community driven initiative designed
    to ensure girls can access sanitary products
    throughout their period. It is the brainchild
    of Anna Miles, a teacher, Jo Willoughby,
    an artist, and Liesl Rose, a holistic therapist.</p>

<h3 id="bloody-good">Bloody Good Period</h3>
  <p>BGP provides menstrual supplies
    and toiletries to asylum seekers,
    refugees and those who can't afford them. It was founded by
    Gabby Edlin. </p>

<h3 id="homeless">The Homeless Period</h3>
  <p>The Homeless Period Project
    was founded in 2015 by Stephanie Arnold and Sharron Champion, with a singularly
    focused mission to provide menstrual hygiene
     products to homeless women living in shelters and on the street. </p>

<h3 id="free-periods">#FreePeriods</h3>
  <p>It's a campaign created by Amika George that seeks to ensure all British
    girls have access to free meals and menstrual products.</p>
