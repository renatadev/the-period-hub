# the-period-hub

The Period Hub's mission is to unify amazing projects altogether 
such as: #FreePeriods, The Homeless Period Project, The red box project and Bloody Good Period,
to finally tackle the period poverty by the end of 2019 with your donations. 

 We work towards : - [x] Tackling Period Poverty in and out the UK.
                   - [x] Educating women and men about periods and menstrual health.
                   - [x] Breaking the silence and taboo around menstruation.

This project was born as a result of developing a website as final project for **CodeFirst:Girls** 
by *Joanna Zamarbide* and *Renata Guerra.*
