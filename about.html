<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<h1>The Project</h1>
  <p>The main reason behind our project is to unify all
    the different organizations that are already working within
    the UK to tackle the Period Poverty inside and outside the UK.
    But... why did The Period Hub come to life? It's simply because
    there are many amazing projects out there working towards
    the same goal but there was a lack of unity in between these
    organizations, that's exactly why we came up with this idea: to
    take the best of all these charities in only one place so you
    meet all the details and it's easier for everyone to colaborate.
    </br>
    Our mission is to work all together to finally tackle
    the period poverty by the end of 2019. As other organizations,
    including the government, pretend to tackle it in many more
    years, which will imply a lot of new generations going through
    the same problems, and for us, this should be inacceptable situation
   as being in the 21st century and seeing the UK having the 5th World's Largest Economy.
    </br>
    We are here to be a voice for all of those women but also a voice
     for these charities that NEED your help, so you can donate through
     The Period Hub and all your donations will be split up
     in same percentages (%) for every single one of the suporters
     we work with. Amazing, huh?

  <h2>Meet Renata</h2>
    <p>As a future Software Developer, Renata loves to solve problems and find solutions.
    The problems of menstrual taboo, period poverty and a sheer lack of knowledge about periods
    is really holding communities back. Renata is all about empowering people to make decisions
    that have a positive impact on their life and its surprising what impact changing how you
    handle your periods can have. She never set out to become an “expert on periods”,
    but the more she finds out the more she realises we all have so much more to learn,
    we need to break down the taboo to solve other problems such as access to adequate sanitation,
     equal access to education for all genders, equality in the workplace, and so much more!

<h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>The Period Hub came to our creators mind in March 2019. Yes, March,
    what a perfect month to be inspired by amazing days such as
    "International Women's Day", "Red Nose Day" and of course: "Mother's Day".
  The combination of all these celebrations, made this idea come up, and as  a result of working on a web site project
  for CodeFirst:Girls, plus having the wonderful experience of being surrounded by amazing women throughout the course,
   Joanna & Renata decided that there was no better time to use
  their Tech skills to make an oustanding final project that helps other women just like them.
